## Analysis Overview
### Purpose

PyBer is a multi-billion dollar player in the rideshare business. While I've only been with the company for two weeks, I was assigned to analyze all of the rideshare data from January to May 2019, including compelling charts to visulalize the data for presentation to the board.
<BR>
  
I used two datasets in this project: ride data with the location, date, & fare per ride, as well as driver information. The data was gathered to compare the fares and quantity of rides & number of drivers for each city type. During the course of this project I was required to create dataframes, plot data into several different chart types, and perform multiple calculations. I made use of the tools available, including Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, and Jupyter Notebook.
