# PyBer Ride Share Analysis
#### A relational study of rides, fares, and drivers and city types

<BR>



## Analysis Overview
#### Purpose

PyBer is a multi-billion dollar player in the rideshare business. While I've only been with the company for two weeks, I was assigned to analyze all of the rideshare data from January to May 2019, including compelling charts to visualize the data for presentation to the board.

I used two datasets in this project: ride data with the location, date, & fare per ride, as well as driver information. The data was gathered to compare the fares and quantity of rides & number of drivers for each city type. During the course of this project I was required to create dataframes, plot data into several different chart types, and perform multiple calculations. I made use of the tools available, including Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, and Jupyter Notebook.

## The differences in data among city types
### Percentage difference between rural vs. suburban & urban city types

<BR>
Referring to the above charts, while rural cities had far fewer rides & drivers, the average fare per ride/driver is quite a bit higher compared to suburban & urban areas. The same thing happened between suburban & urban average fare per ride/driver. I believe this is due to the fact that while rides in rural areas may be fewer, those living in rural communities must travel further to get to their destination, while those living in more populated areas travel shorter distances.

The following chart shows the percentage of fares, rides, and drivers by city type. The largest share of the market is without doubt the urban communities, with rural communities taking only 5.3% of rides during this period. This pattern is reflected throughout the city type percentages.

 Our final chart is a comparison of total fare by city type. The first thing you notice is the relative steadiness of the data, with rural fares being the most consistent.

## Summary
### Business recommendations 
#### In response to the analysis performed, I suggest PyBer consider the following:

__1. Increase the profitability of more-populated urban areas.__
  <BR>
 While urban cities make the most revenue, rural areas are more profitable. The number of rides requested in rural areas is steady because they are not heavily populated areas and likely won't become so, therefore there isn't a lot that can be done to increase the rides. A fare increase for this population is also likely to have stronger opposition than in other areas. I recommend increasing the profitability of more-populated urban areas. 
  <BR>
<BR>
  
__2. Decrease the number of drivers in urban areas.__
  <BR>
Currently there is a glut of drivers in urban communities. Both PyBer and our drivers lose when this is the case. PyBer is impacted by the number of drivers who are being paid without work to do, the driver is impacted by lowering morale and financial hardship due to loss of tips.
<BR>
<br>
  
__3. Perform more research.__
<BR>
Some of the items I suggest researching are the number of drivers vs population density, fare per minute/mile and how they correlate, and to find out when riders are most likely to request rides and use promotions.
