## Analysis Overview
### Purpose

PyBer is a multi-billion dollar player in the ridesharing business. I've been hired to analyze

The purpose of the project was to analyze data for a ridesharing company called PyBer to calculate metrics related to the total weekly fares for each city type the rideshare company operates in. Datasets containing ride and city data were used to calculate metrics such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver for each of the respective city types.The Data sets were also used to create a new data frame to find the average fare per week from January 1st 2019 to April 29th 2019 for each of the city types. The dataframe from the analysis was used to create a multiple-line graph that visualized the total weekly fares for each city type for the before mentioned period. The metrics and visualization created was then analyzed to provide recommendations to the CEO of Pyber to address any disparities among the city types.
