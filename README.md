## Analysis Overview
### Purpose

PyBer is a multi-billion dollar player in the ridesharing business. While I've only been with the company for two weeks, I was assigned to analyze all of the rideshare data from January to May 2019. I also needed to create a easy-to-view, yet compelling, charts for visualization.
<BR>
  
I used two datasets in this project: ride data with the location, date, & fare per ride, as well as driver information. The data was gathered to compare the fares and quantity of rides & number of drivers for each city type. During the course of this project I was required to create dataframes, plot data into several different chart types, and perform multiple calculations. I made use of the tools available, including Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, and Jupyter Notebook.
<BR>
  
This analysis considers the following points among different city types:
<BR>
• Percentage of total rides
  <BR>
• Percentage of total drivers
    <BR>
• Percentage of total fares
      <BR>
• Average fare per ride and driver
        <BR>
• Total fare by city type
          <BR><BR>
