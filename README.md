## Analysis Overview
### Purpose

PyBer is a multi-billion dollar player in the rideshare business. While I've only been with the company for two weeks, I was assigned to analyze all of the rideshare data from January to May 2019, including compelling charts to visulalize the data for presentation to the board.
<BR>
  
I used two datasets in this project: ride data with the location, date, & fare per ride, as well as driver information. The data was gathered to compare the fares and quantity of rides & number of drivers for each city type. During the course of this project I was required to create dataframes, plot data into several different chart types, and perform multiple calculations. I made use of the tools available, including Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, and Jupyter Notebook.

## The differences in data among city types
### Percentage difference between rural vs. suburban & urban city types

<BR>
Referring to the above charts, while rural cities had far fewer rides & drivers, the average fare per ride/driver is quite a bit higher. The same thing happened between suburban & urban average fare per ride/driver. I believe this is due to the fact that while rides in rural areas may be fewer, those living in rural communities must travel further to get to their destination, while those living in more populated areas travel shorter distances.

The following chart shows the percentage of fares, rides, and drivers by city type. The largest share of the market is without doubt the urban communities, with rural communities taking only 5.3% of rides during this period. This pattern is reflected throughout the city type percentages.

 Our final chart is a comparison of total fare by city type. The first thing you notice is the relative steadiness of the data, with rural fares being the most consistent.
